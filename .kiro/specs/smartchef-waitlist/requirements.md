# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves converting an existing SmartChef waitlist design into a production-ready Next.js landing page with email signup functionality, analytics tracking, and proper form handling. The goal is to create a high-converting waitlist page that captures user interest and collects email addresses for the SmartChef AI cooking assistant product.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a potential user, I want to view an engaging landing page that explains SmartChef's value proposition, so that I can understand what the product offers and decide if I want to join the waitlist.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the landing page THEN the system SHALL display the complete SmartChef landing page with all sections from the original design
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL render responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
3. WHEN a user scrolls through the page THEN the system SHALL display smooth animations and transitions as defined in the original design
4. WHEN a user clicks navigation elements THEN the system SHALL smoothly scroll to the appropriate sections
5. WHEN a user loads the page THEN the system SHALL load in under 1.5s on a 4G connection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a potential user, I want to sign up for the SmartChef waitlist with my email address, so that I can be notified when the product becomes available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a valid email address in the signup form THEN the system SHALL validate the email format before submission
2. WHEN a user submits a valid email THEN the system SHALL send the email to the MailerLite API for storage
3. WHEN the email submission is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to a thank-you page
4. WHEN the email submission fails THEN the system SHALL display a styled error message to the user
5. WHEN a user submits an invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display validation errors before attempting API submission
6. WHEN a user submits the form THEN the system SHALL disable the submit button during the async operation to prevent duplicate submissions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want to track user interactions and conversions on the landing page, so that I can optimize the page performance and measure signup success.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the landing page THEN the system SHALL automatically track a pageView event via Splitbee Analytics
2. WHEN a user successfully submits the signup form THEN the system SHALL track a signup_event via Splitbee Analytics
3. WHEN a user clicks any call-to-action button THEN the system SHALL track a cta_click event via Splitbee Analytics
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL include the Splitbee analytics script in the page head
5. WHEN analytics events are sent THEN the system SHALL use the following event schema: pageView (auto-fired), signup_event (successful signup), cta_click (major CTA interactions)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who has successfully signed up, I want to see a confirmation page with next steps, so that I know my signup was successful and can share the product with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully signs up THEN the system SHALL redirect them to /thank-you.html
2. WHEN a user visits the thank-you page THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message stating "You're on the list. SmartChef is cooking something special."
3. WHEN a user is on the thank-you page THEN the system SHALL display consistent branding with the main landing page
4. WHEN a user is on the thank-you page THEN the system SHALL provide a "share with friends" button (stubbed for future implementation)
5. WHEN the share button is clicked THEN the system SHALL log a cta_click event via Splitbee Analytics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be well-structured and documented, so that I can easily maintain and extend the application in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL have clear folder structure with pages, public assets, and scripts organized appropriately
2. WHEN examining the code THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive comments explaining each function and data flow
3. WHEN looking at configuration THEN the system SHALL have clear TODOs for adding MailerLite API_KEY and GROUP_ID
4. WHEN reviewing the implementation THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript for type safety and modern React patterns
5. WHEN examining the code THEN the system SHALL include notes about security considerations and future upgrade paths
6. WHEN viewing scripts THEN the system SHALL abstract sensitive values (API keys) into .env variables using Next.js environment management
7. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL be manually tested across Chrome, Safari, and Firefox

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer deploying the application, I want the code to be optimized for Vercel deployment, so that the application can be easily deployed and served efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the system SHALL use Next.js best practices for static generation and optimization
2. WHEN the application builds THEN the system SHALL produce optimized bundles suitable for production deployment
3. WHEN users access the site THEN the system SHALL serve assets efficiently with proper caching headers
4. WHEN examining the build output THEN the system SHALL include proper meta tags for SEO and social sharing
5. WHEN inspecting the page head THEN the system SHALL include Open Graph and Twitter meta tags for social previews
